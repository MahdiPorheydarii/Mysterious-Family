## Introduction

This project aims to store and represent a family tree using a tree data structure in Python. The values of the nodes in the tree are generated by hashing the names of family members, each node uniquely represent family members. The accompanying web application offers an intuitive interface for visualizing and interacting with the family tree.


## Features

- **Family Tree Implementation:** Utilizes a tree data structure to model relationships between family members.
- **Hashed Names:** Node values are generated by hashing the names of family members for privacy and security.
- **Web Application:** Interactive web interface to view and explore the family tree.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask (for the web application)
